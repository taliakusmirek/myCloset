# Create dataset
# Scrape e-commerce sites for product images using Selenium
# Store data in a structured format 

# Preprocess data
# Resize images for uniformity, then extract features or texture descriptors
# Create labeled datasets with classes for different features


# Model training
# Use TensorFlow and a pretrained CNN
# Finetune model based on dataset outputs (desired features)
# Train separate models for specific tasks such as color extraction, occasion, and weather.

# Deployment
# Saved the trained me and deploy on a cloud service for real-time API calls that users can make on the web app.
